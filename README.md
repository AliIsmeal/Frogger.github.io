This game is part of the Udaicty Front-End Web Dev Nanodgree Program. The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas. Some of the content such as Images and a game loop engine are provided by Udacity, and we need to implement the rest, the enemy class and player class, detect collision between bugs and player and make the player moves up,down,right,left.



## How To Play
1. To start [here](https://aliismeal.github.io/frogger.github.io/)
2. Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board.
3. Each time you reach water your score increases by 1, if your score equals 13 within 2 minutes you win the game, but avoid colliding with the bugs.
1. If you collide with bugs 3 times or spent time more than 2 minutes you lose and the game will be over.
